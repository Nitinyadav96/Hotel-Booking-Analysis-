Hotel Booking Analysis Project
This repository contains the code and resources for analyzing hotel booking data to find solutions for hotel cancellation prediction. 
The project is implemented using Python and various data analysis libraries.

Overview:
In this project, we aim to address this challenge by analyzing historical hotel booking data to identify patterns and factors contributing to cancellations.
By understanding these patterns, hotels can develop strategies to minimize cancellations and optimize revenue.

Features:
Data Analysis: Utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization.
Machine Learning: Applies machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling and classification of hotel cancellations.
Jupyter Notebooks: Includes Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis, code, and visualizations.
Data Visualization: Generates insightful visualizations to illustrate trends, patterns, and correlations in the data.
Interactive Reports: Provides interactive reports for better understanding and presentation of the findings.

Usage:
Explore the provided Jupyter notebooks to understand the data analysis process and findings.
Modify the code or experiment with different algorithms to improve cancellation prediction accuracy.
Use the insights gained from the analysis to develop strategies for reducing hotel cancellations.

Data:
The dataset used in this project contains historical hotel booking information, including details such as booking date, lead time, arrival date, 
duration of stay, and cancellation status. The dataset is anonymized and provided for research purposes.
